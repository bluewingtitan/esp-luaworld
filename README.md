> A fully scriptable, dynamic environment for the esp32 family of micro controllers.
> Mostly for quick development and situations in which dynamic code needs to be executed.

It started as a project to cluster together esp32s to calculate pi, just out of fun.
It then quickly took a turn because I actually was more interested in what it is doing now.
